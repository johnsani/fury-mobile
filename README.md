## Introduction. 
   Seeking to cut down the risk of infection? Have bad habits of not washing your hands? Here is an app for you.
The Handwasher Reminder app aims to help users by sending time-based notifications to remind them about washing their hands. Handwashing is a simple, effective, and inexpensive way to fight off infections and keep yourself healthy.

Whether you are home, at work, travelling, or out in the community, the Handwash Reminder is here to be your hygiene companion. Never forget to wash your hands again.

###### In progress:
So far, weâ€™ve developed the android app for the hand-washing reminder app. In this build, contains the primary feature of the app (a reminder message sent to the user to wash their hands).  The IOS build is under development, so as to have our app run on both platforms, after which secondary features can later be added.  
*PS, IOS development to start next week*
